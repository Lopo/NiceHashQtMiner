In-source builds are disallowed. They are a source of infinite pain,
- cluttering up the source folder
- causing cmake to silently refuse creating out-of-source builds
- overwriting the root Makefile (which contains cleaninsourcebuild)

To perform an out-of-source build, remove ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeCache.txt and
- cd builddir; cmake ..

If you really want to perform an in-source build, use -DALLOW_IN_SOURCE_BUILD=TRUE

You need to run 'make cleaninsourcebuild' right now, since this (failed)
attempt already produced traces of an in-source build.
cmake will attempt in-source-builds instead of regular ones until you clean
those traces (remove CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles).
